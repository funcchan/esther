# Esther #

Esther is a web app that will soon power
[my personal website](https://ryankaskel.com/). It was born out of
frustration with Wordpress formatting.

It is made using:

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
* [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

The project is named after Esther Mountain in the Adirondack Mountains
located in upstate New York, USA.
